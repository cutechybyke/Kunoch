This Repo contains codes for the assessment required for Junior Level Backend Python Developer. 
The codes here was written using Vs-Code It has the JSON file(cars.json), the main.py, which contains the script to read the json files, and a sorting.py file for the sorting in descending order. 
To Read the json file, it's best opened used Vscode,and both the json file and main.py files in the same directory. Please ensure to clone to repository, and python 3 is installed too. 
To run the main.py script, ensure the cars.json and main.py files are in the same directory, then since you're to use vscode, once open, on the main.py terminal, at the top right hand side, 
you'll see a "run python file" button, click it or you can use this :".\main.py" on the terminal, and the script runs. 
For the sorting.py, once you run the terminal, it asks you to enter numbers separated by spaces, which when you click enter, it sorts the numbers you inputed in descending order, and prints it out.
